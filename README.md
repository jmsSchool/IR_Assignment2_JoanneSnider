# IR_Assignment2_JoanneSnider
This project demonstrates my system for creating an IR inverted index, printing to a TSV file, and explorations of TREC_EVAL. 

### Question 3
There are 5 modules for this project. Load into Google Colab, add the additional files that begin with 
"post". Execute the top 4 sections in order to load them into memory. In Section 5, if desired, alter 
the query words or number of Top results to get. Then execute that section
